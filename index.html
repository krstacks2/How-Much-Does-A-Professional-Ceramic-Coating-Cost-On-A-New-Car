                <h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why do new cars need ceramic coatings?</h2><p>New cars, despite their fresh appearance, can benefit greatly from ceramic coatings for several key reasons:</p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Gloss and shine: Ceramic coatings enhance the paint&#8217;s gloss and depth, giving your car a sleek, high-gloss finish. They make your car look stunning and help maintain its showroom shine for longer.</li><li>Enhanced protection: Ceramic coatings create a hydrophobic layer that repels water, dirt, and contaminants. This protective barrier shields the paint from substances like bird droppings, tree sap, and road salts, which can cause long-term damage.</li><li>UV protection: UV rays from the sun can cause paint to fade and oxidize over time. Ceramic coatings protect against UV rays, helping preserve the car&#8217;s color and finish.</li><li>Ease of cleaning: Ceramic coatings&#8217; hydrophobic properties make washing your car easier and less frequent, as water and dirt slide off more easily.</li></ul>

Here&#8217;s a general breakdown:</p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Entry-level coatings: Basic ceramic coatings typically cost between $300 and $800. They offer basic protection and may last for one to two years. This option is ideal if you&#8217;re looking for a more affordable way to protect your new car&#8217;s paint.</li><li>Mid-range coatings: More advanced coatings that offer enhanced durability and longer-lasting protection are priced between $800 and $1,200.
